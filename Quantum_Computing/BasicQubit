# Before creating a quantum node, we need to initialize a device 
# A quantum device is anything that can apply quantum operations and return a value
# Devices include: hardware plug-ins or software 

# The default qubit is a device provided by PennyLane - a simple pure-state qubit simulator
# All devices accept (name) and (wires:number of subsystems device is initiliazed with) as parameters

# Constructing a Quantum Node
# QNodes are an encapsulation of a quantum function. QNodes are bound to a particular device which is 
# used to evaluate expectation and variance values of this circuit
